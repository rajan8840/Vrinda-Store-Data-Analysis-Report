Project goal

Provide a single, interactive Excel dashboard that gives management a quick, visual summary of 2022 performance and enables drill-downs for common business questions such as:


• Which states generated the most revenue?

• How do monthly orders compare to monthly sales (AMOUNT vs Order Count)?

• How are sales split across channels and categories?

• What is the distribution of order statuses (delivered, cancelled, returned, refunded)?

• How do sales differ by gender and age groups?



The dashboard is organized into multiple charts and slicers. Key components:

• Top 5 States (Horizontal bar chart) — Displays the states with the highest sales volumes (Sum of
  Amount), with labels showing amounts in Mn.
  
• Order vs Sales (Combo chart) — Column chart for Sum of Amount per month and an overlaid line for
  Count of Order ID; data table shown below the chart for exact values.
  
• Sales: Men vs Women (Pie chart) — Gender sales share with percentage labels.

• Orders: Age vs Gender (Clustered column + table) — Breakdown of orders by age group and gender
  with percentages.
  
• Orders: Different Channel (Pie chart) — Share of orders across channels like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra,
  Meesho, Ajio, etc.
  
• Order Status (Pie chart) — Numeric breakdown of orders by status: Delivered, Cancelled, Refunded,Returned.

• Interactive Slicers — Month, Channel, Category (to filter all charts instantly).

• Headers and Layout — Clean, print-friendly layout with consistent color palette and card borders.
